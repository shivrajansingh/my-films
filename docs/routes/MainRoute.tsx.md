**Main Route Component Documentation**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

The `MainRoute` component is the main routing configuration for the application. It uses the `react-router-dom` library to define routes and provide a basic navigation structure.

**Import Statements**
--------------------

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import AuthRoutes from './AuthRoutes';
import AppRoutes from './AppRoutes';
import useNetworkStatus from '../utils/hooks/useNetworkStatus';
import OfflinePage from '../pages/OfflinePage';
import ProtectedRoute from './ProtectedRoute';
import PublicRoutes from './PublicRoutes';
```

*   **`BrowserRouter as Router`**: The `BrowserRouter` component is used to enable client-side routing. By importing it and assigning it an alias (`Router`), we can use the shorter name in our code.
*   **`AuthRoutes`, `AppRoutes`, `OfflinePage`, `ProtectedRoute`, `PublicRoutes`**: These are custom components that will be rendered based on the routes defined below.

**Main Route Component**
-----------------------

```jsx
export default function MainRoute() {
  const isOnline = useNetworkStatus();
 
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        {/* Offline route */}
        <Route path="/offline" element={<OfflinePage />} />
        
        {/* Protected route with conditional rendering */}
        <Route element={<ProtectedRoute isOnline={isOnline} />}>
          <Route path="/login/*" element={<AuthRoutes />} />
          <Route path="/p/*" element={<PublicRoutes />} />
          <Route path="/*" element={<AppRoutes />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

### **Offline Route**

*   **Path**: `/offline`
*   **Element**: `<OfflinePage />` - This will render the `OfflinePage` component when the application is offline.

### **Protected Route**

*   **Condition**: The `isOnline` variable, which indicates whether the application has a network connection.
*   **Element**: `<ProtectedRoute isOnline={isOnline} />`
*   **Children Routes**:
    *   **Login Route**: `/login/*` - This will render the `AuthRoutes` component when the user navigates to any URL starting with `/login/`.
    *   **Public Route**: `/p/*` - This will render the `PublicRoutes` component when the user navigates to any URL starting with `/p/`.
    *   **Default Route**: `/*` - This will render the `AppRoutes` component for all other URLs.

**useNetworkStatus Hook**
-------------------------

The `useNetworkStatus` hook is used to check whether the application has a network connection. The `isOnline` variable returned by this hook is passed as a prop to the `ProtectedRoute` component, which uses it to conditionally render its children routes.

### **OfflinePage Component**

This component will be rendered when the application is offline.

### **AuthRoutes Component**

This component will be rendered when the user navigates to any URL starting with `/login/`.

### **PublicRoutes Component**

This component will be rendered when the user navigates to any URL starting with `/p/`.

### **AppRoutes Component**

This component will be rendered for all other URLs.

**ProtectedRoute Component**
---------------------------

The `ProtectedRoute` component uses the `isOnline` variable to conditionally render its children routes. If the application is online, it renders the `AuthRoutes`, `PublicRoutes`, and `AppRoutes` components; otherwise, it renders nothing.

By using a combination of conditional rendering and route configuration, this code provides a robust navigation structure that adapts to different network conditions.
