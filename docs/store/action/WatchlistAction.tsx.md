**Redux Action Creators Documentation**
=====================================

### Overview

The following code defines two action creators in Redux: `setWatchlist` and `setAddToWatchlistDetails`. These functions generate actions that are used to update the state of a Redux application.

### Code Block
```
export const setWatchlist = (payload: Array<Record<string, any>>) => ({
  type: 'ADD_DATA',
  payload: payload
});

export const setAddToWatchlistDetails = (payload: Record<string, any>) => ({
  type: 'ADD_TO_WATCHLIST',
  payload: payload
});
```
### Explanation

#### `setWatchlist` Action Creator

The `setWatchlist` function takes an array of objects (`payload`) as its argument and returns a new action object.

*   **Type**: The `type` property is set to `'ADD_DATA'`, indicating that this action adds data to the state.
*   **Payload**: The `payload` property is set to the input `Array<Record<string, any>>`, which represents an array of objects with arbitrary properties and values. This payload will be used to update the state.

#### `setAddToWatchlistDetails` Action Creator

The `setAddToWatchlistDetails` function takes an object (`payload`) as its argument and returns a new action object.

*   **Type**: The `type` property is set to `'ADD_TO_WATCHLIST'`, indicating that this action adds details to the watchlist.
*   **Payload**: The `payload` property is set to the input `Record<string, any>`, which represents an object with arbitrary properties and values. This payload will be used to update the state.

### Usage

To use these action creators in your Redux application, you would typically dispatch them from a reducer or other component that interacts with the store.

For example:
```
// Assume 'store' is the Redux store instance
const data = [{ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane Doe' }];
const action = setWatchlist(data);
store.dispatch(action);
```
Or:
```
const details = { id: 3, name: 'Jim Doe', email: 'jim@example.com' };
const action = setAddToWatchlistDetails(details);
store.dispatch(action);
```
### Notes

*   These action creators are designed to be used in a Redux-based application. If you're using a different state management system, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
*   The `payload` types (`Array<Record<string, any>>` and `Record<string, any>`) assume that the objects being passed around have arbitrary properties and values. You can adjust these types as needed to match your specific use case.

By following this documentation, you should be able to effectively use the `setWatchlist` and `setAddToWatchlistDetails` action creators in your Redux application.
