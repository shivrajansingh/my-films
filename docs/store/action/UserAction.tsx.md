**User Management Function: `setUser`**
=====================================

### Overview

The `setUser` function is used to manage user data by dispatching an action of type `'ADD_DATA'`. This function takes a payload object as an argument and returns an action object that can be handled by a reducer.

### Code Block
```
export const setUser = (payload: Record<string, any>) => ({
  type: 'ADD_USER',
  payload: payload
});
```

### Parameters

* **`payload`:** An object containing user data. The properties and values of this object are arbitrary and can be customized as per the requirements.

### Return Value

The `setUser` function returns an action object with two properties:

* **`type`:** A string indicating that this is an `'ADD_DATA'` action, which in this case is actually a typo and should be `'ADD_USER'`. This value will be used by a reducer to determine how to handle the action.
* **`payload`:** The user data object passed as an argument to the `setUser` function.

### Usage Example

To use the `setUser` function, you would first import it into your code:
```
import { setUser } from './userManagement';
```
Next, create a payload object with the desired user data:
```
const userData = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com'
};
```
Finally, call the `setUser` function and pass the payload object as an argument:
```
dispatch(setUser(userData));
```

### Notes

* The `type` property in the returned action object should be corrected to `'ADD_USER'`.
* This implementation assumes that you are using a Redux-style architecture with a reducer to manage state changes.
* You can modify the `setUser` function and its usage example to suit your specific requirements.
