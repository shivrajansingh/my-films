**App Layout Component**
=========================

### Overview

The `AppLayout` component is a functional React component that serves as the basic layout structure for an application. It imports necessary dependencies from `react-router-dom` and utilizes them to render a header and footer section, while also providing space for dynamic content to be injected through the `Outlet` component.

### Code

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import Header from './template/Header';
import Footer from './template/Footer';

export default function AppLayout() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Components

#### 1. `Header` Component
---------------------------

*   Imported from `./template/Header`
*   Responsible for rendering the application's header section

#### 2. `Footer` Component
-------------------------

*   Imported from `./template/Footer`
*   Handles the rendering of the application's footer section

#### 3. `Outlet` Component (from `react-router-dom`)
---------------------------------------------------

*   Used to inject dynamic content into the layout structure
*   Replaces a portion of the layout with its children components, which are rendered using the `Outlet` component in the routing configuration

### Functionality

1.  The `AppLayout` component is defined as a functional React component.
2.  It uses the `<> </>` JSX fragment to group the child elements without wrapping them in an extra DOM element.
3.  Inside the JSX fragment:
    *   The `Header` component is rendered, which likely contains links to other pages or app-related information.
    *   The `Outlet` component is used to inject dynamic content into the layout structure. This allows for different routes to be rendered within the same layout template.
    *   Finally, the `Footer` component is rendered, which typically contains copyright information, links to external resources, or other supplementary content.

### Use Cases

*   The `AppLayout` component can be used as a base template for various application layouts.
*   It allows developers to define a consistent layout structure while still enabling dynamic routing and content injection through the use of the `Outlet` component.
