**Header Component Documentation**

### Overview

The `Header` component is a React functional component that represents the header section of an application. It displays a logo, navigation menu, and user profile information.

### Import Statements

```jsx
import Image from "../../common/Image";
import { Link, useLocation, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"
import { auth } from "../../../firebase";
import { signOut } from "firebase/auth";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import Loader from "../../../utils/helper/Loader";
import { clearAllKeys, getAllDatabaseNames } from "../../../utils/helper/IndexDB";
import { connect } from "react-redux";
```

### Interface Definition

```jsx
interface User {
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

The `User` interface defines an object with a dynamic key-value structure. This is used to store user data.

### Component Function

```jsx
function Header() {
  // ...
}
```

The `Header` component function is defined here. It returns the JSX for the header section.

### Dependency Hooks

#### useLocation Hook

```jsx
const location = useLocation();
```

This hook provides the current URL location as a `Location` object.

#### useNavigate Hook

```jsx
const navigate = useNavigate();
```

This hook allows navigation to other routes in the application.

### State Variables

#### user State

```jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({});
```

The `user` state variable stores the current user data as an object of type `User`.

#### isLoading State

```jsx
const [isLoading, setisLoading] = useState(true);
```

This state variable indicates whether the component is currently loading or not.

### useEffect Hook

```jsx
useEffect(()=>{
  // ...
}, [navigate]);
```

The `useEffect` hook is used to handle side effects in the component. In this case, it checks if a user is logged in and sets the `user` state accordingly.

### Logout Function

```jsx
const logout = async() =>{
  // ...
}
```

This function handles the logout process by clearing all keys from the IndexDB, signing out of Firebase, and navigating to the login page.

### Conditional Rendering

```jsx
if(isLoading) return <Loader/>;
// ...
```

If the `isLoading` state is true, the component renders a loading indicator (the `Loader` component).

### JSX for Header Section

```jsx
return (
  // ...
)
```

The JSX for the header section is defined here. It includes:

* A logo with a link to the home page
* A navigation menu with links to various pages
* A user profile area that displays the user's name, email, and photo
* A dropdown menu that allows users to access their account settings and logout

### mapStateToProps Function

```jsx
function mapStateToProps(state: Record<string, any>) {
  return {};
}
```

This function is used to connect the component to the Redux store. In this case, it returns an empty object.

### Export Statement

```jsx
export default connect(mapStateToProps, {})(Header);
```

The `Header` component is exported as a connected component using the `connect` function from `react-redux`.
