**Detailed Documentation of the `AuthFooter` Component**

### Overview

The `AuthFooter` component is a functional React component (FC) that renders a footer section for an authentication page. It includes copyright information and links to the website's privacy policy and terms and conditions.

### Code Block
```jsx
import { FC } from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const AuthFooter: FC = () => {
  return (
    <footer className="footer">
      <div className="container">
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-md-6">
            <div className="copyright-2024">
              Copyright &copy; 2024 My Films. All rights reserved.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-6">
            <div className="privacy-policy-terms-and-container">
              <span>
                <span className="privacy-policy">
                  <Link to="/p/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link> &nbsp;
                </span>|
                <span className="terms-and-conditions">&nbsp;
                  <Link to="/p/terms-condition">Terms and Conditions</Link>
                </span>
              </span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </footer>
  );
};

export default AuthFooter;
```

### Breakdown of the Code

#### Import Statements
```jsx
import { FC } from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
```
The code starts by importing two essential components from React and React Router:

* `FC` (Functional Component) from React, which is used to define a functional component.
* `Link` from React Router, which is used to create links between routes.

#### Definition of the `AuthFooter` Component
```jsx
const AuthFooter: FC = () => {
  // component code here
};
```
The `AuthFooter` component is defined as an FC using the `FC` type from React. The component takes no props and returns a JSX element.

#### JSX Element Returned by the Component
```jsx
return (
  <footer className="footer">
    <!-- footer content here -->
  </footer>
);
```
The component returns a single `<footer>` element with a class of "footer". This is where we'll add the copyright information and links to the website's policies.

#### Container and Row Elements
```jsx
<div className="container">
  <div className="row">
    <!-- content here -->
  </div>
</div>
```
The footer contains two main sections: a container (`<div class="container">`) and a row (`<div class="row">`). The container holds the copyright information, while the row holds the links to the website's policies.

#### Copyright Information
```jsx
<div className="copyright-2024">
  Copyright &copy; 2024 My Films. All rights reserved.
</div>
```
This section displays the copyright information for the website, including the year and the owner.

#### Links to Website Policies
```jsx
<div className="privacy-policy-terms-and-container">
  <span>
    <span className="privacy-policy">
      <Link to="/p/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link> &nbsp;
    </span>|
    <span className="terms-and-conditions">&nbsp;
      <Link to="/p/terms-condition">Terms and Conditions</Link>
    </span>
  </span>
</div>
```
This section contains two links: one to the website's privacy policy and another to its terms and conditions. The `Link` component from React Router is used to create these links.

#### Export Statement
```jsx
export default AuthFooter;
```
Finally, the component is exported as the default export of the file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

### Conclusion

The `AuthFooter` component is a reusable piece of code that can be used to display copyright information and links to website policies. It's designed to work with React and React Router, making it easy to integrate into existing applications.
