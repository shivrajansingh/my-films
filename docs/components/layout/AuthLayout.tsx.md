**AuthLayout Component Documentation**
======================================

### Overview
------------

The `AuthLayout` component is a custom layout component that provides a basic structure for authentication-related routes in a React application using the `react-router-dom` library.

### Code Block
-----------------

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react"
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom"
import AuthHeader from "./template/AuthHeader"
import AuthFooter from "./template/AuthFooter"
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

export default function AuthLayout() {
  const navigate = useNavigate(); 
  useEffect(()=>{
    let user = localStorage.getItem('user'); 
    if(user){
      navigate("/")
    }
  }, [navigate]);
  return (
    <>
      <AuthHeader/>
        <Outlet/>
      <AuthFooter/>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Explanation
---------------

#### Importing Dependencies

The component imports the following dependencies:

* `useEffect` from `react` for handling side effects
* `Outlet` from `react-router-dom` to render child routes
* `AuthHeader` and `AuthFooter` from local templates, which are custom components providing header and footer functionality for authentication-related routes
* `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` to navigate between routes

#### Defining the Component

The component is defined as a functional component named `AuthLayout`. It uses the `export default` syntax to export it as the default export.

#### Using Navigate Hook

Inside the component, the `useNavigate` hook is used to get an instance of the `navigate` function. This function allows navigating between routes programmatically.

#### Side Effects with useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook is used to handle a side effect: checking if a user exists in local storage and navigating to the root route (`"/"`) if so. The dependency array `[navigate]` ensures that this effect is re-run whenever the `navigate` function changes, which should never happen due to its immutable nature.

#### Returning JSX

The component returns JSX that represents its structure:

* An `AuthHeader` component as a header
* A dynamic child route rendered by the `<Outlet />` component
* An `AuthFooter` component as a footer

### Usage
---------

To use this component, simply import it and render it in your application, just like any other component.

```jsx
import AuthLayout from './AuthLayout';

function App() {
  return (
    <AuthLayout>
      {/* Child routes will be rendered here */}
    </AuthLayout>
  );
}
```

Note that the `AuthLayout` component should be wrapped around child routes to function correctly.
