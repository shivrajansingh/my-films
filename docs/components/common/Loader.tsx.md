**Loader Component Documentation**
=====================================

### Overview
---------------

The Loader component is a reusable React component that displays a loading indicator to the user.

### Code Snippet
-----------------

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Image from './Image'

export default function Loader() {
  return (
    <div className="loader text-center">
      <Image src="/assets/images/loader.svg" alt="Loading..." />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Breakdown
--------------

#### Import Statements

* `React` is imported from the `react` library, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* `Image` is imported from a local file (`./Image.js`), which suggests that this component has been created elsewhere in the project.

#### Export Statement

* The `Loader` function is exported as the default export of this module, making it available for import by other components.

#### Function Definition

* The `Loader` function returns a JSX expression that defines the component's UI.
* The `return` statement wraps the entire component in a `<div>` element with class name `"loader"` and text content `"text-center"`.
* Inside this container, an `<Image>` component is rendered with the following props:
	+ `src`: the source URL of the loading image (`/assets/images/loader.svg`)
	+ `alt`: the alternative text for accessibility purposes (`"Loading..."`)

### Usage
------------

To use the Loader component in your application:

1. Import the Loader component into the desired file: `import Loader from './Loader'`
2. Render the Loader component within a suitable container: `<Loader />`

Example:
```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Loader from './Loader'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Some content */}
      <Loader />
      {/* More content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```
### Props and State
--------------------

The Loader component does not accept any props or maintain state. It is a simple, static component that displays a loading image.

### Accessibility
-----------------

The Loader component includes an `alt` prop on the `<Image>` element to provide alternative text for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

### Styles
------------

The loader component uses CSS classes (`loader`, `text-center`) to style its appearance. You can customize these styles by adding or overriding rules in your project's stylesheet.
