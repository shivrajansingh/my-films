**Detailed Documentation of WatchlistItem Component**

### Overview

The `WatchlistItem` component is a React functional component that displays a single item in the watchlist or public movie list. It receives props from its parent component and uses them to render the necessary information.

### Import Statements

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Image from '../common/Image'
import { setDeleteRequest } from '../../store/action/MoviesAction'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'; 
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

* `React` is imported as a dependency for the component.
* `Image` is imported from another file (`../common/Image`) to display images in the component.
* `setDeleteRequest` is imported as an action creator from the Redux store (`../../store/action/MoviesAction`). It will be used to set a delete request for the movie item.
* `connect` is imported from the `react-redux` library to connect the component with the Redux store.
* `Link` is imported from `react-router-dom` to enable routing between components.

### WatchlistItemProps Interface

```jsx
interface WatchlistItemProps{
    details : Record<string, any>;
    type:string;
    setDeleteRequest : (payload : Record<string, any>) => void; 
}
```

* The `WatchlistItemProps` interface defines the shape of the props that will be passed to the component.
	+ `details`: an object with properties that are not defined specifically. This is a generic type that can contain any data.
	+ `type`: a string that indicates whether the item is in a watchlist or public movie list.
	+ `setDeleteRequest`: a function that takes a payload as an argument and sets a delete request for the movie item.

### WatchlistItem Component

```jsx
function WatchlistItem(props:WatchlistItemProps) {
    const { type } = props; 
    const { name, image, number_of_movies, total_hours } = props.details; 
    var user = { photoURL : "", displayName : ""}; 
    if(type === 'public' && props.details.hasOwnProperty('user')){
      user = props.details.user; 
    }
    // ...
}
```

* The `WatchlistItem` component is a functional component that takes in the `props` object.
* It uses destructuring to extract the `type` property from the `props` object and assign it to a local variable.
* It also extracts other properties (`name`, `image`, etc.) from the `details` object in the `props` and assigns them to local variables.

### Variables and Functions

```jsx
var user = { photoURL : "", displayName : ""}; 
if(type === 'public' && props.details.hasOwnProperty('user')){
  user = props.details.user; 
}

const handleDelete = () =>{
    props.setDeleteRequest({
      title : name, 
      type : type,
      details : props.details
    })
}
```

* The `user` variable is initialized with a default value, but if the item is in the public movie list and has a user property, it will be assigned to this variable.
* The `handleDelete` function is defined. It calls the `setDeleteRequest` action creator from the Redux store and passes an object with properties (`title`, `type`, and `details`) that correspond to the movie item.

### JSX Code

```jsx
return (
    <div className="col pt-3">
        <div className="category-items" >
            // ...
```

* The JSX code returns a `<div>` element with a class name of "col pt-3".
* Inside this div, another div is rendered with a class name of "category-items".

### Event Handling

```jsx
{
  type === 'watchlist' ?  <div className="trash-icon">
  <Image src="/assets/images/Frame 277131902.svg" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#delete-confirmation" onClick={handleDelete}/>
</div> : ""
}
```

* An event handler is attached to the image element that will trigger when clicked. If the item is in a watchlist, it will call the `handleDelete` function.

### Routing

```jsx
{
  type === 'public' ?  
  <Link to={"/watchlist/trending-watchlist/"+props.details.id}><div className="black-film"></div></Link> :  
  <Link to={"/watchlist/"+name}><div className="black-film"></div></Link>
}
```

* If the item is in a public movie list, it will render a link that will route to another component. The `type` property determines whether to route to `/watchlist/trending-watchlist/` or `/watchlist/`.

### Redux Connection

```jsx
function mapStateToProps(state:Record<string, any>){
    return { 
        deleteRequest : state.MovieDetailsReducer.deleteRequest
    }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, {setDeleteRequest})(WatchlistItem);
```

* The `mapStateToProps` function is defined. It takes in the state object and returns an object with a property called `deleteRequest`.
* The `connect` function from the `react-redux` library is used to connect the component with the Redux store.
* The `setDeleteRequest` action creator is passed as a prop to the connected component.

### Export Statement

```jsx
export default WatchlistItem;
```

* The `WatchlistItem` component is exported as the default export of this file.
