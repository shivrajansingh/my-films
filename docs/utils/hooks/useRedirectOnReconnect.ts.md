**useRedirectOnReconnect Hook Documentation**
==============================================

**Overview**
------------

The `useRedirectOnReconnect` hook is a React hook designed to automatically redirect users back to their previous location when they reconnect to the internet after losing connection.

**Code Block**
-----------------

```
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useNavigate, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

const useRedirectOnReconnect = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const location = useLocation();
  const isOnline = navigator.onLine;

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleOnline = () => {
      const returnPath = (location.state as { from?: string })?.from || '/';
      navigate(returnPath);
    };

    if (isOnline) {
      const returnPath = (location.state as { from?: string })?.from || '/';
      navigate(returnPath);
    } else {
      window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    }

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    };
  }, [isOnline, navigate, location]);

  return isOnline;
};

export default useRedirectOnReconnect;
```

**Explanation**
---------------

### Importing Dependencies

The hook imports the `useEffect` and `useNavigate` hooks from the `react` and `react-router-dom` libraries, respectively.

### Function Definition

The `useRedirectOnReconnect` function is defined as a React hook using the `const` keyword. This function will be used to redirect users back to their previous location when they reconnect to the internet.

### Variables and Functions

#### `navigate`

The `navigate` variable is obtained from the `useNavigate` hook, which provides a function for navigating between routes in the application.

#### `location`

The `location` variable is obtained from the `useLocation` hook, which provides an object containing information about the current location, such as the path and state.

#### `isOnline`

The `isOnline` variable checks whether the user's internet connection is online using the `navigator.onLine` property.

#### `handleOnline`

The `handleOnline` function is defined to handle the case where the user reconnects to the internet. It navigates back to the previous location using the `navigate` function.

### Effect Hook

The hook uses the `useEffect` hook to run some side-effect code when certain conditions are met. In this case, the effect runs when:

* The `isOnline` variable changes (i.e., when the user reconnects or disconnects from the internet)
* The `navigate` function is updated
* The `location` object changes

When the effect runs, it checks whether the user is online and, if so, navigates back to their previous location. If not, it adds an event listener for the `online` event on the `window` object, which will trigger when the user reconnects.

### Cleanup Function

The hook returns a cleanup function that removes the event listener added in the effect hook, ensuring that it is properly cleaned up when the component is unmounted.

### Return Value

Finally, the hook returns the `isOnline` variable, indicating whether the user's internet connection is currently online.

**Usage**
------------

To use this hook in your React application, import it and call it as a function. For example:

```
import useRedirectOnReconnect from './useRedirectOnReconnect';

function App() {
  const isOnline = useRedirectOnReconnect();

  if (isOnline) {
    // Navigate to the dashboard page when online
    navigate('/dashboard');
  } else {
    // Display a message indicating that the user is offline
    return <div>Offline</div>;
  }
}
```

Note: This documentation assumes that you have already set up a React application with the `react-router-dom` library and are familiar with its API.
