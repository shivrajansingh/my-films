**Code Documentation: Exporting Environment Variable as API URL**

### Overview

This code snippet exports an environment variable `REACT_APP_OMDB_URL` as the value of a constant `SEARCH_API`. This is typically used in React applications to store sensitive data, such as API keys or URLs.

### Code Block
```
export const SEARCH_API: any = process.env.REACT_APP_OMDB_URL;
```

### Explanation

#### Export Statement

The code starts with an `export` statement, which makes the constant `SEARCH_API` available for import in other parts of the application.

#### Constant Declaration

The `const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable named `SEARCH_API`. This means that once assigned a value, it cannot be reassigned or changed later in the code.

#### Type Annotation (`: any`)

A type annotation `: any` is added after the `SEARCH_API` identifier. This tells TypeScript (or other type systems) that the type of this constant is "any" â€“ essentially meaning it can hold values of any data type.

#### Process Environment Access

The expression `process.env.REACT_APP_OMDB_URL` accesses an environment variable named `REACT_APP_OMDB_URL`. In a Node.js or React context, `process.env` provides access to environment variables. The value assigned to this constant is the string value of the `REACT_APP_OMDB_URL` environment variable.

#### Usage Context

In the context of a web application built with React, especially when integrating APIs (like the OMDb API), it's common practice to store sensitive data such as API keys or URLs securely using environment variables. This way, even if your source code is exposed or accessed by unauthorized parties, they won't have direct access to your API credentials.

### Example Use Case

When you need to make requests to the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API for searching movies, you can use this constant as the base URL for your requests. Here's an example with `fetch` API:
```
// Assuming SEARCH_API is already set up
const movieSearchUrl = `${SEARCH_API}&s=${searchTerm}`;
fetch(movieSearchUrl)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
This code uses template literals to construct a URL for searching movies based on the value of `SEARCH_API` and adds the search term as a query parameter. The fetch API is then used to send a GET request to this constructed URL, logging any received data or displaying an error if it occurs.
